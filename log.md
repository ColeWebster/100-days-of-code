# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 29th 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I contionued to work on my JavaScript Fundamentals. Reviewing the basics of structure in objects, and literals. 

**Thoughts:**: It has been good to work on these items as I haven't focused on them in a bit. Good to build that foundation again for the future.
